# Project 3 Feedback

## Project Strengths

* Love the layout of the homepage and the banner image. It really conveys the modern look you're going for :)
* Nice use of Mapbox API to show the location.
* Great job with the mailer logic! It looks ready to go once you have your users table set up in the database.

## Areas of Improvement

* See code comments marked with `CJ`
* I would focus next on your database. Start with users being able sign up and log in, then create a table of events that you can display on your site. A stretch would be to flag certain users as "admins" who can log in and add events.
* Next time you're working on a project focus on way more frequent and descriptive commit messages. You should have at least 20-30 for a project like this.
